# The Print Function in Python

## What is the Print Function?
- In every programming language, there is a way to **output data to the terminal**.  
- In Python, the **`print()` function** is used to display data on the screen.

## Hello World Example
- One of the first programs you write in any language is a simple **Hello World!** program.
- In Python, it’s simple:

```python
print('Hello world!')  # Output: Hello world!
```

Here, 'Hello world!' is a string, a sequence of characters surrounded by single (') or double (") quotes.

This string is an argument passed to the print() function.

## Printing Multiple Values

- You can print multiple values at once by separating them with commas:

``` python
print('My favorite colors are', 'blue', 'green', 'red')
# Output: My favorite colors are blue green red
```

- Python automatically adds a space between each item when you use commas.

- This is useful when you want to print multiple pieces of information together.

## Summary

- The print() function displays output in the terminal.

- You can pass one or multiple arguments to it.

- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in ' ' or " ".

- Python adds spaces automatically when printing multiple values separated by commas.
